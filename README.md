# Wave-Generator
Analog signal generator, with USART control feature, intended for STM32F4 attached to custom circuit board. This was a final project for a microprocessors class taken during my last semester in college.


See docs/readme.pdf and docs/maintainer.pdf for information on the individual source files and program as a whole. Some files mentioned in docs/readme.pdf have been omitted, renamed and/or relocated, but most of the source code files are present and unchanged.
