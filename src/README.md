All files prefixed by "_ti" are entirely my work. 

Other files may or may not have been altered, but were provided to me. Some of these include the postfix "_edit".

The entry point, "main_new.c" is largely provided code/constants. The main function within it initializes and starts up the program.

This project was developed using the Keil MDK-ARM IDE, but the project files and other linking items have been omitted. Code compiled using Yagarto.
